# Machine Learning - Regression examples

This repo contains a few examples about how to setup different regression models using just Python.

* **Linear Regression**:
The simplest one, it can predict labels using just a line to abstract the behaviour of the context (just one feature)
* **Multiple Regression**
It can predict labels using a multi-dimensional space to abstract the behaviour of the context (multiple features)
* **Logistic Regression**
It can classify wrapping the predicting function into a sigmoid and rounding the result between two classes (binary classification)

## How to test

To launch the samples just `cd` into the folder containing the `.py` file you want to launch and run `python <nameFile.py>`
